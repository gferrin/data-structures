My pop() time is constant or O(1) time. I adapted my class from c++ list pop_front()
which works by adjsting a few pointers, whcih will always be the same no matter the size 
of the list, making it constant time. That and the website with the documentation also 
says its constant http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/pop_front/


template <typename T>
void Queue<T>::pop()
{
	array.pop_front();
}
